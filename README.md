## Admin Panel Access

Various features of the app can be controlled from the _Admin Panel_. This is a website (outside of the app itself) for club officers and advisors, ASB members, and staff.

This admin panel is available a t[ https://fremont-app-backend.vercel.app/admin/.](https://tinyurl.com/fremont-app) You can login with your FUHSD Google Account by clicking the _Sign in with Google_ button. Anyone can login; however, to perform any actions, you must first be added as an admin to at least one _Organization_ (these include ASB, each graduating class, and clubs).

If you've logged onto the app in the past, you've likely already been added as an admin to any clubs you're an officer of. If you haven't, please let one of us know (contact information is at the top of the document) so we can add you.

## Organization Management

You can manage general information about any of the Organizations you're a part of on the [_Organizations_](https://fremont-app-backend.vercel.app/admin/core/organization/) tab.

There are a couple fields here you can edit:

**Advisors/Admins.** Only advisors can edit other advisors, while both advisors and admins can edit admins. To add someone, start typing their name and autocomplete should pop up. If you can't find a user, that means they haven't logged in to the app yet.

**Name.** The name of the organization as displayed everywhere on the app and in other pages like the points view. Please only make small edits to this field. The name should remain mostly the same.
